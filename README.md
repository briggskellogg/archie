# Intersect

## The Problem

I wanted a way to think through decisions without getting stuck in my own head. Every AI assistant I tried felt one-dimensional — either too logical, too agreeable, or too detached from how I actually think.

What I needed was **multiple perspectives in one place** — something that could challenge me, support me, and help me see angles I'd miss on my own.

## The Process

I built Intersect for one specific workflow: **thinking out loud**.

When I have a decision to make, an idea to explore, or something I need to work through — I don't want one voice. I want three. I type what I'm thinking, and three distinct minds respond: one for gut instinct, one for logic, one for the deeper "why."

They agree. They disagree. Sometimes they debate.

The best thinking happens when you're not the only one in the room.

## The Product

Intersect is a native macOS app powered by [OpenAI GPT-4o](https://openai.com) and [Anthropic Claude](https://anthropic.com). It gives you three AI perspectives — Snap (instinct), Dot (logic), and Puff (psyche) — orchestrated by a Governor that decides who speaks and when.

Your data stays on your device. The agents learn your patterns over time.

I built this for myself, but you can use it too.
